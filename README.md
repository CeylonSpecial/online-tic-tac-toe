***This project is still in progress***

About:
This is my second project in the Full Stack JavaScript learning path and my seventh overall project of The Odin Project coursework.

Assignment:
Create an online Tic-Tac-Toe game that you can play in your browser.

Objectives:
- practice using JavaScript modules and factory functions, use as few global variables as possible
- use different objects for different parts of the program (gameboard, players, display controller, etc.)
- place 'X' or 'O' onto board when div is clicked by user
- prevent players from selected an already occupied space
- build logic for checking for ties and wins
- add interface for user to add name, play/restart button, display element for congratulating winner
- optional: create an AI so the user can play against the computer

Progress Thus Far:
I have completed the required part of the project. The look of the page and gameplay function with a partner are complete. I would like to go back and reorganize/clean up the format of the modules and overall code structure once I'm satisfied with the AI. The AI is functioning, but I am working on debugging. Currently, my goal for the AI is to make it unbeatable, afterword I will add difficulty options for the user to select.
